# Inventory and Account Management System

## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort between students, built upon the foundational structure provided by the professor. The application is based on JavaFX and simulates an inventory and account management system. The database is XML-based, providing a lightweight yet structured method of storing and retrieving data.

Users can access two main interfaces:
1. **Admin Interface**: Manage accounts and view inventory and account information.
2. **Customer Interface**: Change password, place orders, and view previous orders.

## Features
- **XML Database**: Utilizes XML for storing inventory and user account data.
- **User Authentication**: Differentiated login for admin and customer accounts.
- **Inventory Management**: For admins to oversee and modify, if required.
- **Order Management**: Customers can place and view their orders.
- **Account Management**: Admins can manage user accounts, while customers can modify their own account details.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Java and JavaFX set up on your machine to run the application.

## How to Run the Project
1. First, compile and run the `StoreServer.java`

2. Once the server is up and running, compile and execute `Store.java`

After this, the application will start and you'll see the login interface where you can access either the admin or customer scenes based on your account type.
